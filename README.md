# HangmanGame
This project mimics the logic of a hangman game. A random mystery word is selected from a text file containing a list of words.
The user is then allowed to guess the mystery word by entering a single letter during each turn.
The game ends when the user either guesses the mystery word or reaches 8 incorrect guesses.
